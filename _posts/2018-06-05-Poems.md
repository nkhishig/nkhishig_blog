**Lost in depression**

1.

I am lost in the forest  
that has no end.  
Darkness swallows me whole &  
chews on my insecurities;  
the leftover fear must have tasted  
sweet &  
my sadness bitter

2.

I am cradling my knees &  
closing my eyes because  
the song of hopelessness  
overwhelms the realms of my heart &  
gnaws at the pathetic  
with its endless repetition


**Midnight w/ coffee**


I like my coffee cold  
Ice cold  
Actually make it extra iced  
My favorite color is blue  
But not dark blue, or regular blue  
It’s blue but light blue  
Light blue with hints of pink and purple  
Did you know my name is a color too?  
It’s turquoise green or more like aqua green  
I use Photoshop to search colors in hexadecimals  
I say it’s #4beac3  
And at night I think about   
Nano scale particles with  
Conjugated mouse hair in  
Two waves mixed but not degenerately &  
Charged spheres that don’t attract  
Who am I kidding?  
I go back to  
Sudokus left unsolved  
I paint a picture of my sanity  
Illusions that satisfied  
My ice cold  
Heart  
Filled w/  
Ice cold  
Coffee, no wait  
Change that to  
Americano  
It is a bit  
Expensive  
But suits  
My taste  

**Depression on the loop**


1.
here comes the inexplicable sadness  
the uncontrollable urge to cry  
once more, trees hum tunes of eternal despair  
and the sky reflects the dullness of heart  

now the edge of vertigo is near  
doubts and insecurities still inhabit me  
they are haunting, oh so haunting!  
asking for more  

please  
just  
let me go  

2.
i learned to live through disappointments  
they are always waiting at the door  
‘Happiness is not real’  
i heard the whisper from the walls  

i long for days of timeless quietude  
but that is not where i belong  
i can’t prove my own worthiness  
so the loop of hopelessness  

kills me  

once more  


**Fleeting Joy**


fresh crisp apples dance  
in the angry orchard  
with slightly drying finish  
Are cider apples different  
from regular apples?  
I could not stop myself asking  
I glanced to  
the bottle in my hand  
With eyes senseless  
Time was on a big jet plane  
Flying at a speed of sound  
I slowly brought the bottle to my lips  
I laughed emptily to the  
monty python jokes  
on repeat  
In the background  
while I cherished the last  
drop of cheap hard cider.  
life seemed good  
while it lasted  

**Tree**
  
 
                      I think every tree is unique
                their branches, their leaves, their colors
            whether they have friends they talk to nearby
        I’d imagine they would all have their tales and stories
        leaves fall one by one, I see someone blowing the leaves
        off the pavement and it’s sad to see them piled up where
      instead they can roam and bring color to grey. I look at them 
      while I walk by, I stare at the leaves in contrast to the sky,
      & I like trees in fall the most because of their majestic colors
       they are beautiful in their own way, I try to imagine whether
          they see us at all. I don’t think an ugly tree exists.
              If they could talk -  happy or sad, I’d listen.
                              I like trees
                                  
                                do you
                                     
                                  ?
 
                             hear them sing
                              
   
**Untitled #3** 


A pristine chapel I see  
Beside the lake so serene  
Stars glisten above with glee  
A heartwarming scenery  

Sound of raindrops I hear  
A soft whisper in the ear  
Trees rustle above so high  
An everlasting lullaby  

Solitude I sought thus  
To escape the reality so unjust  
To erase the scars that brought me pain  
I silently wept to the rain
