milá [^1]		

							_dedicated to you, teta, if only I could see you again_

I saw a cane 
a ballast for her wobbly knees
donning normal clothes &
normal hair with silver streaks 
light was performing a ribbon dance 
gymnastics, aerobics - I’m not sure which 

her smile, so sweet 
a homemade apple pie with cream  
a cradling hand to my tears
your voice calling out to me 

her eyes, a lighthouse 
dancing on the line of dayspring
a sunflower facing up
waiting for the arrival of 

you are here 

I am once again on my bicycle 
with wheels of fortune turning 
I shout and scream and beg 
only to feel your warmth in a
cosmic bubble, burst  
into tears, a sunshower -- 

I have always been here

leaves weaving, a blanket to the core
soft like your caress, a kiss to
my forehead, my hands 
reaching out to   

milá, I am you and you are me 

love emanates like a lullaby
from a trinket you held 
dear, the sunshine is
here

[^1]: mila translates to 'dear' or 'love' from Slovak

         _Come stand before me, child 
	  Whisper unto me your sins and repent_  

a figure from 		eons ago,
a time of innocence &
illusion, 	looms before me 
small and still, 	asking me 
to pour out once more 
what was lost, 			a love  

                _inaction was my sin_  
                _ingratitude rips 	 the flesh_ 

golden light 	      was he 
gentle wind         a gentler soul 
holding out his everything 	to 
me, a naive trust 	      	in love 

                 _What is love to you, little one_
                 _Show me you have learned_ 
  
left you stranded	      	at night 
a promise unfulfilled 	  empty words 
a paper plane   	flew 	
                                 carrying whispers
                                                      of longing 
unopened, a play of fate 
selfish tricks or, 

                        _self sacrifice_ 

poetry is my mnemotechnic 
let this be a record then 
of a chance not taken 
a pure love marred

		                    _forgive me for I have sinned_ 

he appears in front 
a cheeky grin, he wears
_it’s been a long time coming 
such a long, long time_ [^3]
