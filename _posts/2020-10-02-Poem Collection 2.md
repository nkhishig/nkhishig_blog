milá [^1]

&emsp;	&emsp;	&emsp;  _dedicated to you, teta, if only I could see you again_

I saw a cane   
a ballast for her wobbly knees  
donning normal clothes &  
normal hair with silver streaks   
light was performing a ribbon dance   
gymnastics, aerobics - I’m not sure which   

her smile, so sweet  
a homemade apple pie with cream    
a cradling hand to my tears  
your voice calling out to me   

her eyes, a lighthouse  
dancing on the line of dayspring  
a sunflower facing up  
waiting for the arrival of   

you are here  

I am once again on my bicycle  
with wheels of fortune turning  
I shout and scream and beg  
only to feel your warmth in a  
cosmic bubble, burst  
into tears, a sunshower --   

&emsp; _I have always been here_  

leaves weaving, a blanket to the core  
soft like your caress, a kiss to  
my forehead, my hands   
reaching out to   

&emsp; milá, _I am you and you are me_   

love emanates like a lullaby  
from a trinket you held  
dear, the sunshine is  
here   

[^1]: mila translates to 'dear' or 'love' from Slovak

&emsp;  &emsp;        _Come stand before me, child   
&emsp;	&emsp;       Whisper unto me your sins and repent_    

a figure from 	&emsp;	eons ago,   
a time of innocence &  
illusion, &emsp; looms before me   
small and still, &emsp; asking me  
to pour out once more  
what was lost, 	 &emsp; &emsp;	a love    

&emsp; &emsp;               _inaction was my sin_    
&emsp; &emsp;               _ingratitude rips 	 the flesh_   

golden light  &emsp; was he  
gentle wind   &emsp;  a gentler soul   
holding out his everything  &emsp;to  
me, a naive trust  &emsp;  &emsp; in love   

 &emsp;  &emsp;                _What is love to you, little one_  
 &emsp;  &emsp;               _Show me you have learned_   
  
left you stranded &emsp; &emsp; at night  
a promise unfulfilled 	 &emsp;  empty words   
a paper plane    &emsp;	flew 	
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; carrying whispers  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; of longing  
unopened, a play of fate  
selfish tricks or,  

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;   _self sacrifice_  

poetry is my mnemotechnic    
let this be a record then  
of a chance not taken  
a pure love marred  

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  _forgive me for I have sinned_  

he appears in front  
a cheeky grin, he wears  
_it’s been a long time coming   
such a long, long time_ [^3]   

[^2]: A flower of sorrow and regret
